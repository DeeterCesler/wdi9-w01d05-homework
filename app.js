// 1. Variable & Datatypes
    // A. Q + A
        // How do we assign a value to a variable?
            // const variable = value;
        // How do we change the value of a variable?
            // varible = newValue;
        // How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
            // newVariable = existingVariable;
        // Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
            // declare is when you establish a new variable
            // assign is when you give that variable a value
            // define is when you re-assign a value
        // What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
            // it's writing out what you want your code to do in plain english to clarify what you'll actually work on
        // What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
            // roughly 75% of time planning, 25% of time typing
